SHORT WRITE UP TEXT ON MY DOG PET STORE DATABASE
The dog pet store data base is an electronic record of data that shows over thirty dog breeds each sold to a different customer at a certain price.
The database consists of three tables with multiple attributes 
The first table being the dogs table this includes the:
•	The dog_id that is a primary key and uniquely identifies each dog in the pet store 
•	The dog_name that shows the name of every dog in the pet store
•	The breed_id (a foreign)that shows that each dog in the pet store has its own breed that’s uniquely identified 
•	The sex that indicates the gender of that specific dog.
•	The age in months of the dog in the pet store.
•	The price of each dog.
The second table being the customers table this includes the:
	The customer_id that is a uniquely identifies each customer that has bought a dog in the pet store.
	The customer_name that shows the name of every customer that has bought a dog in the pet store
	The breed brought illustrates the breed of dog the customer came in with before they bought a specific dog.
	Address of the customer that shows their location or the new household of the dog 
	The dog_id that is a foreign key linking the dog table to the customer table.
The third table being the breed table this includes the:
o	The breed_name which is a column containing all kinds of breeds the pet store was able to sell.
o	The breed_id which is the primary key in this table and links the dog table to the breed table 
Thus this table acts as the joining table for the database interrelating all the three.
